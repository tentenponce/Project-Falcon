# Project-Falcon
<b>SMS System Notifier</b>

Falcon receives text from anyone and alerts everyone on the house by creating a buzz/noise. Everytime a person is detected by Falcon (Using Motion Sensor), it checks if the message received is still unread and buzz again and again until they read the message.
